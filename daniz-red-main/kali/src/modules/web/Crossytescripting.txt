       --->>Cross-site scripting<<---


This attack consists on modify values that web aplication uses to send variables between two web sites. To perform this attack we need 3 tools that are already installed on the docker_compose, this 3 tools are: (Hint: Can be deployed from diferent terminals for better results)

-->Firefox: to test the webpage and to capture important data.
   First, to be abble to use a gui.

   xhost +  , and then:  sudo docker-compose run firefox
	

-->From here, a docker terminal needs to be used

   Run the following command: (hint: the proxy on 127.0.0.1 need to be set)


   If is necesary
     /
    /
   (sudo) docker-compose run burp


   -->Burpsuite: to capture packets on the network and obtain a request packet that can be used   to perform the attack. (hint: the packets interception needs to be enabled on burpsuite and could be used to insert custom payloads to exploit this vulnerability (using url encoder))
      
      Code:
      
      ./bin/burpsuite


   -->XSStrike: to perform an automatic cross-site scripting test and generate payloads. (hint: use -u "target with a place to insert code")
      
      Code:

      sudo python3 XSStrike/xsstrike.py [commands]
